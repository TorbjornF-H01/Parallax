        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
            Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, known as the "Red Planet" for its distinct reddish hue, is a
            fascinating world with half the diameter of Earth and a gravity 37% that of Earth's. It boasts the largest
            volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system, Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively. Mars
            has a thin atmosphere, primarily of carbon dioxide, and features such as ancient riverbeds and polar ice
            caps suggest it once harbored liquid water, offering clues to a potentially more hospitable past. The planet
            experiences dynamic weather, including massive dust storms, and has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. It
            has been the focus of numerous robotic explorations, revealing insights into its geology and potential for
            ancient microbial life. With ongoing plans for human missions, Mars remains a key target for future
            exploration, promising to unravel more secrets of our solar system and the possibility of life beyond Earth.

        <h2>Starship at Starbase</h2>
        <p>
            SpaceX's Starship is a groundbreaking, fully reusable spacecraft designed to transport up to 100 people and
            cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and potentially beyond. It features a two-stage design with the Super
            Heavy booster and the Starship upper stage, both powered by methane-fueled Raptor engines, emphasizing
            reusability and cost reduction in space travel. Starship's versatility supports a wide array of missions,
            from satellite launches and International Space Station servicing to interplanetary exploration, notably
            including NASA's Artemis lunar missions. Its development, marked by iterative testing at SpaceX's Boca Chica
            facility, showcases innovative design elements like a heat-resistant shield for atmospheric re-entry. Beyond
            immediate space exploration goals, Starship aims to enable sustainable human presence on Mars and
            revolutionize space travel, backed by both private investment and strategic partnerships, including
            significant contracts from NASA.
